Colors are explained under The Prompt in the README shown at https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/. To summarize:

Cyan means the branch matches its remote
Green means the branch is ahead of its remote (green light to push)
Red means the branch is behind its remote
Yellow means the branch is both ahead of and behind its remote
The +~-! status represents added/modified/removed/conflicted file count in your index (dark green) and/or working directory (dark red).
